# CS370-FinalProject

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The code that we were provided for this assignment were two setup python files comprising of GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py. The code that I created implements reinforcement learning algorithms that loops through the code to find an optimal solution through the game. This leveraged Keras and Tensorflow libraries in order to find the path.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists break down complex concepts and make them into their least complex parts. They then take these ideas and implement this into the best possible code that can be written. This includes making sure that the code is understandable and well written as well. The way this can help a company like Grazioso Salvare who has large files is to help sort the data and manage it in a more simple fashion. With such large amounts of data, without automating it, it would be very difficult to maintain.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
The way that I approach a problem as a computer scientist is to break the problem down into the smallest parts possible. Generally this involves a flowchart which then is converted to pseudocode, and then the actual code is written. This makes sure that I am writing the most concise code possible. The assignments in this course required those strategies while also the need for research for the code being written. In previous courses the code was a little more simple or the implementation may have been easier to understand. In this course it took a bit to make sure that the best code possible was written. I would continue to use these strategies in the future as well for database work.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization
The obligations to the end user are to reach the goals the end user is looking to complete. It is also important that the end user's data is safe as well. For the organization, it is most important that I perform my duties well, securely, and and focus on the final product.
